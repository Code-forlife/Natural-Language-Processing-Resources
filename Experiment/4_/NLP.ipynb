    "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a hypothesis given observed evidence. In the context of text classification, Naive Bayes is often used to categorize documents into predefined classes or categories based on their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simplified explanation of the Naive Bayes text classification algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bayes' Theorem:**\n",
    "   Bayes' theorem is the foundation of Naive Bayes. It states:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "   In the context of text classification:\n",
    "   -  P(A|B)  is the probability of document belonging to class A given the observed words in the document.\n",
    "   -  P(B|A)  is the probability of observing the words in the document given that the document belongs to class A.\n",
    "   -  P(A)  is the prior probability of a document belonging to class A.\n",
    "   -  P(B)  is the probability of observing the words in the document (regardless of class).\n",
    "2. **Naive Assumption:**\n",
    "   The \"naive\" assumption in Naive Bayes is that the features (words in the case of text classification) are conditionally independent given the class label. This means that the presence or absence of a particular word does not affect the presence or absence of any other word. Although this assumption simplifies the model, it may not hold true in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text Classification:**\n",
    "   In text classification, a document is represented as a bag-of-words, which disregards the order of words and focuses only on their frequency. Each word becomes a feature, and the model calculates the probability of a document belonging to each class based on the presence or absence of these words.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The probability of a document D belonging to class C is calculated as:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "    P(C|D) \\propto P(C) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(w_i|C) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "   - P(C): Prior probability of class C.\n",
    "   -  P(w_i|C) : Probability of word w_i occurring in documents of class C.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Smoothing:**\n",
    "   To handle the issue of zero probabilities when a word is not present in the training data for a particular class, smoothing techniques like Laplace smoothing or add-one smoothing are often employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Classification Decision:**\n",
    "   The class with the highest posterior probability is assigned as the predicted class for the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is computationally efficient, especially with large datasets, and it often performs well in text classification tasks, despite its simplifying assumptions. It's widely used in spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document categorization."

    "\n",
    "- Precision is a component of accuracy that specifically considers the positive predictions. If a model has high precision, it means that when it predicts a positive instance, it is likely to be correct. However, a model can have high accuracy even if its precision is not perfect.\n",

    "### Medical Diagnosis:\n",
    "Consider a medical test for a rare disease. Let's say the disease occurs in only 1 out of 1000 people (0.1%). If a model predicts a person has the disease, it may be more crucial to ensure that the prediction is correct because the consequences of a false positive (incorrectly diagnosing a healthy person as having the disease) can be severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario:**\n",
    "  - Total instances (population): 100,000\n",

This matters because falsely diagnosing a person with a rare disease can lead to unnecessary stress, treatments, and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, or other contexts where the cost of false positives is high, precision becomes a more critical metric than accuracy.
